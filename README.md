DMCI-XC8
========

This code is early alpha - it works on my setup :-).

A Microchip RTDM implementation for PIC16 micros. The target for this demo is PIC16F1509, however, any PIC16 with ADC, hardware UART, and enough
memory for desired DMCI buffers should be capable of running it.

A demonstration of PIC16 micro reading its own fixed voltage reference with different values of sampling delay
 is available on Youtube -> http://youtu.be/aeVTITW3ltM
Presented in DMCI in real time. For more details see http://circuitsathome.com
